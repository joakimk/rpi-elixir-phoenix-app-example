An example of how to run a phoenix app using [dockerized Elixir](https://github.com/joakimk/rpi-elixir) on a Raspberry Pi.

## How to run

Just put [an OS with docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/) on it's memory card, run `docker run -p 4000:4000 joakimk/rpi-elixir-phoenix-app-example` and visit <http://your-raspberry-pi-ip:4000> and you should see something like:

## About

* Built on [rpi-elixir](https://github.com/joakimk/rpi-elixir).
* Dockerizes [chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example)

## Benchmark

Please do benchmarks! :). Would be fun to see how much a Pi running phoenix can handle. It can certainly respond quickly (~1ms).

A quick bench with 100 concurrent clients showed ~535 reqs/sec (32 000 RPM) for "GET" request to "/".

```
Concurrency Level:      100
Time taken for tests:   18.477 seconds
Complete requests:      10000
Failed requests:        0
Write errors:           0
Total transferred:      22100000 bytes
HTML transferred:       20240000 bytes
Requests per second:    541.21 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       184.772 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       1.848 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          1168.03 [Kbytes/sec] received
```

Would be interesting to know how many channel clients it could handle at a resonable level of service (1 second or less to broadcast to everyone).

## Building

This takes 15 minutes on a Raspberry Pi 2.

    make

There is probably quicker ways to run a phoenix app in docker, like mounting volumes, but for releasing it as a complete image that is about the time it takes unless you cache some dependencies (git, hex, rebar, maybe compiled dependencies) in a base image.

It's probably possible to compile the elixir code on another box and deploy it to the Pi as well.

## Publishing

    docker tag 5555555555 joakimk/rpi-elixir-phoenix-app-example:latest

    docker login

    # This takes about a minute:
    docker push joakimk/rpi-elixir-phoenix-app-example:latest
